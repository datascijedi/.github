## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the GitHub home of the JEDI Outreach Group. The Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Outreach Group is a community of statisticians and data scientists committed to supporting a society that values all people. We are an outreach group of the [American Statistical Association](https://amstat.org). 

Our website is open-source and you can find the [repository here](https://github.com/datascijedi/website), along with [contributor documentation](https://github.com/datascijedi/website/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started. You can also check out the live website at https://datascijedi.netlify.app. Eventually, you will be able to view this website live at http://www.datascijedi.org/ as well. 

Hope to see you around!
